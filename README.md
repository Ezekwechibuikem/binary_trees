#Binary Tree#

*Binary tree*
- It is a hierarchical data structure comprising nodes, where each node has at most two children nodes. The top node is called the root, and from there, branches extend downward, forming the structure of the tree. Nodes without children are referred to as leaf nodes. Binary trees serve various purposes in computing, including data organization, sorting, and searching.

*Difference Between Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST)*:
- While both are binary trees, a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized version with a particular ordering property. In a BST, the left child of a node contains values less than the node's value, while the right child contains values greater than the node's value. This inherent ordering facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, distinguishing it from a general binary tree.

*Gain in Time Complexity Compared to Linked Lists*:
- Binary trees offer significant time complexity advantages over linked lists for certain operations. While linked lists have a linear time complexity (O(n)) for searching, insertion, and deletion, binary trees, especially BSTs, have an average time complexity of O(log n) for these operations. This improvement arises from the hierarchical nature and ordering properties of binary trees, enabling faster access to elements.

*Depth, Height, and Size of a Binary Tree*:

- Depth: The depth of a node in a binary tree refers to the length of the path from the root to that particular node. It indicates how many levels deep the node is within the tree.
- Height: The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. Alternatively, it signifies the maximum depth of the tree.
- Size: The size of a binary tree represents the total number of nodes it contains, encompassing both internal nodes and leaf nodes.

*Traversal Methods in Binary Trees*:
There are several traversal methods used to navigate through a binary tree:

- In-order traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
- Pre-order traversal: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
- Post-order traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.

*Types of Binary Trees*:

- Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- Full Binary Tree: A binary tree where each node has either zero or two children.
- Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring relatively uniform distribution of nodes and optimized performance.#Binary Tree#
